## 🧭 Vision
BitcVision is born from the belief that **technology should include everyone**.  
We aim to create an **inclusive Web3 ecosystem** on the **Hedera Network**,  
empowering people with different disabilities to experience independence, dignity,  
and equal opportunity in the digital world.

---

## 💡 Mission
To design a **multi-interface Web3 accessibility platform** that bridges the gap between  
blockchain innovation and human inclusion — offering voice, visual, and simplified interaction  
for users with various disabilities.

## 🌐 The Problem
More than **1.3 billion people with disabilities** face barriers to participation in Web3 —  
interfaces too complex, numbers too small, designs not inclusive enough.  
For many, this means **being excluded from financial freedom** and digital independence.

---

## 🌱 The Solution
BitcVision creates a **unified accessibility layer** for Web3 users:  

- 🎧 **Voice-driven access** to data, prices, and transactions  
- 👁️ **High-contrast visual mode** for low-vision users  
- ♿ **Multi-disability inclusion design** (visual, auditory, mobility, and cognitive)  
- 🌍 **Global community & open-source collaboration**

Together, these features redefine how people with disabilities connect to the blockchain world.

Each accessible interface, each inclusion feature, is a step toward **a more humane blockchain**.
